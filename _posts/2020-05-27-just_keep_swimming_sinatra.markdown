The past few months have been a whirlwind of emotions. With the shutdown of many countries and actually living through a worldwide pandemic my thoughts and emotions have been a roller coaster causing me to lose focus toward the beginning of the Sinatra project. I had started a new job,  I was so behind on coursework and did not beleive that I was understanding the material enough to even begin the project. I just kept thinking to myself, "you are about to ruin an opportunity you have created for yourself if you dont pull your life out of the pandemic"! after starting my project a week late I was defeated and decided to take a break from coding to watch movies and to my suprise Finding Nemo was playing. The quote "just keep swimming" stuck in my head after the movie finished playing. It was a reminder that no matter how behind you get, or defeated you may feel, the only way to actually moe forward is to just keep swimming. With a newly sparked motivation, I got back to work and was able to successfully complete my first website. I think that if I had better time it would be of better quality but given the mental struggle that I had to overcome daily to not just give up, I am proud of myself. 

After this quarantine, I plan to return to the world better than I was before. Remember to "just keep swimming" when the waters get rough, dark and cold. Never give up!
