The Internet is a cycle of HTTP requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and is considered a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, with no way to access the previously executed command. It is the protocol used by the World Wide Web and defines how the servers and the web clients communicate.
An HTTP client is a piece of hardware or a software that sends an HTTP request to access the server. Clients are commonly web browsers like Chrome or Safari, APIs making requests to a server, or command line requests.

When you enter a URL in your browser, you are actually sending an HTTP request to the Web server. An HTTP request is a string of text generated by the web client and sent to the server communicating which resource a web clients wants to interact with and how. The request consists of a URL and an HTTP verb. The resource is specified in the URL sent with the HTTP request. For example, if we enter http://amazon.com into the web browser, the request sent is looking for the Amazon resource on the server. There are four common request methods and/or verbs that are used in HTTP request that determine how the web client will interact with the requested resource. They help us to carry out CRUD and are as follows: 
GET: Retrieves the resource sent by request URL unchanged.
POST: Sends a new submission of the resource and asks the server to store it.
PUT/PATCH: Updates an existing resource.
DELETE: Deletes an existing resource.

The HTTP response is the information sent by a server to the web client and is determined by the HTTP verb sent with the request. Once the request reaches the server, the server will query the database for the requested resource, load the resource into an HTML page, and return the HTML text as the message body of the HTTP response. 
HTTP responses contain a status code, requested resource and a message body as mentioned above. If the request is successful in finding the resource then it will return a status code of 200, the requested resource and the HTML page rendered by the browser. If unsuccessful it will return an error status code, no resource will be returned, and usually an HTML error page is rendered by the browser.
