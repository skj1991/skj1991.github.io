My first two attempts at starting the Software Engineering program didn’t turn out quite as I had planned or hoped and left me feeling a bit doubtful on if I should even continue. I choose to continue the journey and after finishing the CLI project, I feel so accomplished! This is the first goal that I have set to challenge myself academically in a while and I am so proud of myself. I wish you could see how hard I am smiling while writing this. Now, if I am being completely transparent, my current feeling of pride initially started as uncontrollable anxiety due fear of letting myself down again and I over thought this entire process!

As we approached project week, my nerves began to increase. I had made it this far before and didn’t feel confident enough in myself to really attempt it. So, I decided to prepare differently this time in an effort to relieve some of my nervousness. I planned out my weeks and gathered all of the walkthrough videos I needed to watch and other resources to get on the right path. I decided to create a CLI program that would allow a user to search local events and began to search for an API. Since this was my first time really looking for an API, I quickly became overwhelmed. After setting up a one-on-one with my cohort lead and explaining my idea and what I had found thus far he was able to reassure me that I was actually on the right path and was amazing support throughout the project. Whenever I was doubtful about my code I was able to lean on my cohort lead to help me realize and understand errors. My success the third time around is contributed to me actually utilizing ALL of my resources and talking with someone else about the code.  Learning to code is challenging and no amount of preparation can truly prepare you for every error but being able to lean on a community of people dedicated to teaching and others learning along side is really making the tough moments manageable!

Oh! and PRY is my best friend now! :)
